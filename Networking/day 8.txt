how to choose suitable data center storage?
-Scalability: The scalability of data center storage is an important element that influences the business. Compared with NAS and SAN, DAS has very limited scalability. Before making a decision, companies need to investigate the amount of data to store according to their requirements.
Performance: Whether data center storage has a good performance or not affects the company's choices a lot. Then NAS is not a good choice if the company takes the performance of data center storage seriously.
-IT staff: Some companies may prefer data center storage which is easy to manage and deploy. Due to the complexity of SANs, professional IT staff is required to maintain the device, which can be a burden for some companies.
-Usage case: Because of its low price and limited IT resources, DAS is more suitable for small-to-medium-sized businesses. For those larger enterprises looking for better performance and scalability, NAS and SAN can better meet their needs.

What is a data center firewall?
A data center firewall is a software or hardware device that is used by data centers for maximizing security. It is a 5-tuple network layer that serves as a multitenant software-designed networking (SDN) device. The purpose of a firewall is to monitor the traffic entering and exiting an organizationâ€™s network. In the industry jargon, this network is called a perimeter. For fragmented network perimeter, the firewall can work at subsequently smaller levels down to the workload level, filtering out external threats.

How does a data center firewall work?
Data center administrators install and configure the firewall by creating access control lists (ACLs) which are applied to a network interface or a subnet. They implement the firewall policies at the switch port of each tenant VM (virtual machine), and the Network Controller pushes these through the portal for distribution amongst all applicable hosts. This way, tenant administrators can enable and configure the firewall to divert unwanted traffic from internet and intranet networks securing their own.
The firewall can control the traffic flow in multiple ways depending on their designs. Legacy architectures typically offer static packet filtering, stateful inspection, and proxy services. Modern-day firewalls have supplemented the architecture with advanced threat analysis, intrusion detection (IDS/IPS), and application context. These modern analytics make it much easier to evaluate the content of incoming traffic.

Firewall Types by Systems Protected

A network firewall is positioned at the juncture between trusted and untrusted networks, such as internal systems and the internet. Its primary role is to monitor, control, and decide on the validity of incoming and outgoing traffic based on a predefined set of rules. These rules are designed to prevent unauthorized access and maintain network integrity.
The operational function of a network firewall lies in its ability to scrutinize each data packet. By comparing packet attributes like source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and port numbers to its established rules, it effectively blocks potential threats or undesired data flow. Whether implemented as hardware, software, or both, its placement ensures comprehensive traffic screening.
Beyond simple traffic regulation, network firewalls offer logging capabilities. Logs assist administrators in tracking and probing suspicious activities.

A host-based firewall is software that operates on a singular device within a network. It is installed directly onto individual computers or devices, offering a focused layer of protection against potential threats. By examining the incoming and outgoing traffic of that specific device, it effectively filters harmful content, ensuring that malware, viruses, and other malicious activities do not infiltrate the system.
In environments where network security is paramount, host-based firewalls complement perimeter-based solutions. While perimeter defenses secure the broader network's boundaries, host-based firewalls bolster security at the device level. This dual protection strategy ensures that even if a threat surpasses the network's primary defenses, individual computers remain shielded.

hardware firewall

https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/hardware-firewall.png?imwidth=1366

A hardware firewall is a physical device placed between a computer or network and its connection to the internet. It operates independently of the host device, examining inbound and outbound traffic to ensure compliance with set security rules. By actively analyzing packets of data, the hardware firewall can identify and block threats, providing a robust barrier against potential cyber intrusions.
The operation of a hardware firewall involves connecting it directly between the internet source and the target network or system. Once implemented, all internet traffic, whether incoming or outgoing, must pass through this device. As it inspects each data packet, decisions are made based on predefined security policies. Malicious or suspicious traffic is blocked, so only safe and legitimate data reaches the internal network. Threats are intercepted before reaching internal systems, offering a proactive approach to network security.

software firewall
https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/software-firewall.png?imwidth=1366
 
A software firewall is a firewall in a software form factor rather than a physical appliance, which can be deployed on servers or virtual machines to secure cloud environments.
Software firewalls are designed to protect sensitive data, workloads and applications in environments wherein it is difficult or impossible to deploy physical firewalls.
Software firewalls embody the same firewall technology as hardware firewalls (also known as next-generation firewalls or NGFWs). They offer multiple deployment options to match the needs of hybrid/multi-cloud environments and modern cloud applications. Software firewalls can be deployed into any virtualized network or cloud environment.

Types of Software Firewalls
 
Container Firewalls
Virtual Firewalls
Cloud Firewalls
Managed Service Firewalls 

A hardware firewall is a standalone physical device positioned between the network and its connected devices. It monitors and controls both incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security policies. Deployment of a hardware firewall requires skilled personnel to ensure proper setup and ongoing management.
On the other hand, a software firewall operates within a server or virtual machine. This type of firewall runs on a security-centric operating system, typically layered over generic hardware resources. It can often be rapidly implemented using cloud automation tools.
Both hardware and software firewalls provide essential protection for network security, with their choice determined by specific requirements and deployment contexts.

Firewall Types by Placement within Network Infrastructure
Internal Firewall
https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/internal-firewall.png?imwidth=1366

An internal firewall functions primarily within a network's confines, targeting security threats that may have already penetrated the perimeter defenses. Unlike external or perimeter firewalls which focus on incoming external threats, internal firewalls concentrate on the traffic between devices within the network. This is relevant because not all threats originate from the internet. Issues can arise from within an organization, be it unintentional employee errors or malicious intentions.
This type of firewall operates under the principle of Zero Trust. It doesn't automatically trust any activity just because it originates from within the network. By segmenting the network into distinct zones, each with its specific security measures, the firewall ensures potential threats don't spread unchecked across the entire system. Micro segmentation, for instance, is a technique wherein the network is divided into smaller, isolated zones, enhancing security.

distributed firewall

https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/distributed-firewall.png?imwidth=1366
 
A distributed firewall is a network security mechanism designed to safeguard an organization's entire infrastructure. Unlike traditional firewalls, which are typically concentrated on a single node or device, distributed firewalls operate across a network. They harness the capabilities of multiple devices to monitor and regulate traffic, ensuring consistent and complete protection.
One primary advantage of distributed firewalls is their ability to monitor both internal and external traffic. Conventional firewalls, historically, have focused on external threats. However, as security threats evolve, the need to monitor internal traffic for potential threats has become paramount. Distributed firewalls fill this gap, examining traffic both within and entering the network, thus offering a more comprehensive security layer.
 

PERIMETER FIREWALL 
 
https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/perimeter-firewall.png?imwidth=1366

A perimeter firewall establishes the boundary between a private network and the public domain of the internet. Functioning as the primary defense, this type of firewall meticulously inspects every data byte attempting to pass through. This safeguards the private network from unwarranted and potentially harmful data. A significant role of a perimeter firewall involves differentiating and subsequently allowing or disallowing traffic based on pre-defined parameters, ensuring only legitimate and safe data gains entry.
The efficacy of a perimeter firewall hinges on its ability to recognize and discern the nature of data packets. It examines both the header information and the payload of each packet to determine intent. This level of examination aids in the identification of potential threats, like malware or indications of a looming cyberattack, facilitating timely preventive action.

 https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/ngfw.png?imwidth=1366

A next-generation firewall (NGFW) extends the capabilities of traditional firewalls, offering more comprehensive security solutions. Unlike their predecessors focused primarily on stateful inspection, NGFWs provide enhanced features to understand and control application traffic, integrate intrusion prevention mechanisms, and utilize cloud-sourced threat intelligence. This evolved approach ensures a more meticulous inspection of data packets, accounting for the intricate nuances of modern cyber threats.
Beyond access control, NGFWs are adept at addressing modern challenges like advanced malware and sophisticated application-layer attacks. They delve deeper into the data, examining the nature of the traffic and identifying patterns that could signal potential threats.

Packet Filtering Firewall
 
https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/packet-filtering-firewall.png?imwidth=1366

Packet filtering firewalls operate at the network layer, responsible for regulating the flow of data packets between networks. These firewalls rely on pre-defined rules that evaluate specific attributes of the packets such as source IP, destination IP, ports, and protocols. If the attributes match the established rules, the packet is allowed to pass through. If not, the packet is blocked.
Types of packet filtering firewalls can be further broken down into static packet-filtering firewalls, dynamic packet-filtering firewalls, stateless packet-filtering firewalls, stateful packet-filtering firewalls.

Circuit Level Gateway

https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/circuit-level-gateway.png?imwidth=1366

A circuit-level gateway functions primarily at the session layer of the OSI model. Its role is to oversee and validate the handshaking process between packets, specifically for TCP and UDP connections. By examining the handshake process and the IP addresses associated with packets, this firewall identifies legitimate traffic and deters unauthorized access. A circuit-level gateway primarily focuses on header information, ensuring the traffic aligns with the firewall's rule set without delving into the actual content of the data packets.
When a user seeks to initiate a connection with a remote host, the circuit-level gateway establishes a circuit, which is essentially a virtual connection between the user and intended host. This gateway then supervises the traffic traversing this circuit.

Web Application Firewall
 
https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/web-application-firewall.png?imwidth=1366
 
A web application firewall, commonly referred to as WAF, serves as a specialized layer of protection for web applications, web servers, and APIs. It functions by examining and filtering HTTP traffic, thereby safeguarding web applications from threats like cross-site-scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and file inclusion. WAFs differentiate themselves by operating at Layer 7, specifically targeting application layer threats.
Positioned in front of web applications, WAFs act as reverse proxies. This means that they intercept and inspect requests bound for the web application, ensuring only legitimate traffic passes through. Any suspicious or malicious traffic is promptly blocked, preventing potential attacks. This architecture not only enhances the security of web applications but aids in shielding applications from direct exposure to internet threats.
To maintain efficiency, WAFs employ policies or sets of rules. These rules help the firewall discern between benign and potentially malicious traffic.
 
Proxy Firewall
https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls/proxy-firewall.png?imwidth=1366

A proxy firewall stands as a vital defense mechanism for networks, operating at the application layer. Also referred to as an application firewall or gateway firewall, it primarily functions as an intermediary, filtering messages between computer systems and external servers. By doing so, it safeguards network resources from potential cyber threats.
Unlike conventional firewalls, which do not decrypt or extensively inspect application protocol traffic, proxy firewalls delve deeper. They scrutinize traffic entering and leaving a network, identifying signs of potential cyberattacks or malware. Central to their operation, firewalls maintain their own Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This design ensures that external networks cannot directly access the protected internal network.
